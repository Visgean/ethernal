            <a href="https://github.com/Visgean/ethernal">Ethernal</a> is Ethereum blockchain explorer created by
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/visgean">Visgean Skeloru</a>.
            The purpose of creating another blockchain explorer was to educate myself
            with Ethereum data structures and to explore the data behind the network.
        </p>
          <p>
            Down there you can see latest Ethereum block as it was returned from
            Geth node. Some of the fields are modified - bloom filter is shortened.
            All prices, costs and taxes are converted to Ether.
        </p>
        <p>
